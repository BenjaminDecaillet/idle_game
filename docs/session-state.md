## 2. In-progress unit

None — S0 just landed.

## 3. Decisions & assumptions (autonomous, veto-able)

- Branch is `feat/workforce-and-shop` per the task brief (overrides the
  harness-suggested `claude/workforce-and-shop-teovzu`).
- Builder pool starts at 1 in `createCountry()` (Gabriel's gift is simply
  pre-granted, per country) — avoids an unclaimable-training dead state.
- `floor-build` lives on `CompanyState.timedActions` (targetId = company
  id); `company-build` on new `CountryState.timedActions` with a `siteId`
  payload (no CompanyState exists yet).
- First company of any country founds instantly (tutorial + prestige
  restarts stay friction-free); ramp starts at company #2.
- Gabriel's floor gift = global `floorGiftClaimed` flag + a claim button on
  floor 2 of the first company of the starting country; bundles
  `freeFastForwards += 1` (durable counter; cost 0 while > 0).
- Shop cash packs anchor on `grossRewardRate` (never negative), gated by
  `requiresCompanies`; debt countries just get wallet credit (one wallet —
  UI copy explains it pays debt first).

## 4. Next action

S1: `src/game/types.ts` — add `BuilderState`, `CountryState.builders` +
`CountryState.timedActions`, extend `TimedActionKind` +
`siteId?` payload, `GameState.freeFastForwards`/`floorGiftClaimed`; then
`engine.ts` `SAVE_VERSION = 9` + defaults, `save.ts` hygiene, save tests.

## 5. Build health

Not yet run this session (docs-only so far). Last known: 352/352 green on
master.
